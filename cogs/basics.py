1. Use `/setup add_region` to add US states to your server
   - Add key battleground states first: Pennsylvania, Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin
   - Include safe red states: Texas, Alabama, Wyoming  
   - Include safe blue states: California, New York, Massachusetts
   - Add swing states: Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina

2. Use `/setup set_start` to set your election start date
   - Format: YYYY-MM-DD
   - Example: `/setup set_start 2024-01-01`
   - This determines when your election cycle begins

3. Use `/setup set_announcement_channel` for election updates
   - Choose a channel where all major election events will be announced

4. Use `/party admin create` to create custom parties if needed
   - Default parties: Democratic Party (Blue), Republican Party (Red), Independent (Purple)
   - Example: `/party admin create name:"Green Party" abbreviation:"G" color:"00FF00"`

5. Use `/election admin set_seats` to configure election seats
   - Sets up all available offices: Senate, House, Governor, President, VP

**Step 2: Understanding Election Phases**
‚Ä¢ **Signup Phase** - Candidates register using `/signup`, `/pres_signup`, `/vp_signup`
‚Ä¢ **Primary Campaign** (2-4 weeks RP time) - Campaign within parties, build momentum
‚Ä¢ **Primary Voting** (1-3 days RP time) - Automated/admin-controlled voting
‚Ä¢ **General Campaign** (4-8 weeks RP time) - Party nominees face off, momentum crucial
‚Ä¢ **General Voting** (1-3 days RP time) - Final election, winners determined
‚Ä¢ **Governance** - Winners serve terms, setup for next cycle

**Step 3: Time Management**
- Use `/time current_time` to check current election phase
- Real time vs RP time: Admins can set how fast time moves
- Example: `/time set_time_scale 60` means 1 real hour = 1 RP day
- Elections automatically progress through phases

**Essential Commands:**
‚Ä¢ `/help commands` - View all available commands
‚Ä¢ `/time current_time` - Check current phase and date
‚Ä¢ `/signup` - Register as a candidate (during signup phase)
‚Ä¢ `/speech` - Give a basic campaign speech (1 hour cooldown, 6 stamina)
‚Ä¢ `/momentum status` - Check state momentum
‚Ä¢ `/demographic_status` - Check demographic progress (presidential candidates)

**Stamina System Overview:**
‚Ä¢ **General Candidates**: 100 total stamina, 50 regenerated per day
‚Ä¢ **Presidential Candidates**: 300 total stamina, 100 regenerated per day
‚Ä¢ **Campaign Actions**: Range from 1.0-2.5 stamina cost
‚Ä¢ **Demographic Actions**: Higher costs (1.5-2.5) but longer cooldowns
‚Ä¢ **Strategic Planning**: Monitor stamina to maintain campaign activity"""

- **Moderate (0.10x)**: Average demographic influence
- **Strong (0.25x)**: Demographics very influential in that state
- **Leadership Bonus**: Leading a demographic gives additional state multipliers

**Strategic Example:**

                "title": "üåä Momentum System",
                "content": """**Understanding Political Momentum**
The momentum system simulates how parties gain and lose influence in states based on campaign activity, scandals, and voter sentiment.

**Core Momentum Mechanics**
- Successful campaign actions build momentum
- Momentum multiplies effectiveness of future actions
- High momentum makes everything easier
- Momentum decays over time without activity

**Momentum Vulnerability**
- Parties with high momentum (50+ points) become vulnerable
- Opponents can trigger "momentum collapse" 
- Collapses cause massive momentum loss (30-70%)
- Vulnerable parties have warning indicators (‚ö†Ô∏è)

**State Political Leans**
Every state has a baseline political lean that affects momentum:
- **Strong Lean** (1.5x momentum gain): Deep red/blue states
- **Moderate Lean** (1.2x momentum gain): Typical partisan states
- **Weak Lean** (1.0x momentum gain): Light red/blue states  
- **Swing State** (0.8x momentum gain): True purple states

**Examples by Category:**
- **Strong Republican**: Alabama, Wyoming, Idaho
- **Swing States**: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin
- **Strong Democratic**: California, Massachusetts, Hawaii

**Building Momentum Strategies**

**1. Fortress Strategy**
- Pick 2-3 states to completely dominate
- Campaign relentlessly in these states
- Build massive momentum reserves

**2. Expansion Strategy**  
- Start with natural strongholds
- Gradually expand to competitive states
- More risky but higher potential reward

**3. Surgical Strategy**
- Focus on specific types of states
- Deep expertise in chosen battlegrounds

**Momentum Collapse System**
- Momentum above 50.0 points creates vulnerability
- Multiple party members can trigger collapses
- 6-hour cooldown between collapse attempts
- Reduces momentum by 30-70% of current total

**Defensive Strategies:**
- Monitor momentum levels carefully
- Build momentum in multiple states to spread risk
- Keep party members ready to trigger collapses on opponents
- Have backup campaign plans ready

**Campaign Effectiveness Multipliers:**
- **Positive Momentum**: Every 25 points = +50% campaign effectiveness (max +200% at 100 momentum)
- **Negative Momentum**: Every -25 points = -25% campaign effectiveness (min -75% at -75 momentum)
- **Base Multiplier**: 1.0x with no momentum

**Strategic Implications:**
- Every 10 points of momentum = ~1% polling shift
- **Momentum multiplies all campaign action effectiveness**
- High momentum makes every action significantly more powerful
- Negative momentum severely handicaps campaign efforts
- Late momentum swings can overcome early deficits
- Timing of momentum building is crucial
- Success breeds more success through multiplier effects"""

                "content": """**Special Election System Overview**
Special elections are called when House seats become vacant outside of regular election cycles. They follow a fast-paced 4-day timeline with unique mechanics.

**Special Election Timeline**
- **Day 1**: Signup Phase (24 hours)
- **Days 2-4**: Campaign Phase (72 hours)
- **End of Day 4**: Results declared

**Special Election Commands**

**User Commands:**
- `/special signup` - Register for an active special election
- `/special speech` - Give campaign speech (1 hour cooldown, 2-4 points)
- `/special poster` - Create campaign posters (1 hour cooldown, 1-3 points)
- `/special ad` - Run video advertisements (1 hour cooldown, 3-6 points)
- `/special calendar` - View election timeline and status
- `/special poll` - Conduct NPC polling with 7% margin of error

**Admin Commands:**
- `/special admin call_election` - Call special election for vacant House seat
- `/special admin end_election` - End active special election
- `/special admin set_winner` - Manually set election winner

**Eligibility and Requirements**
- **Seats Eligible**: Only House seats (REP- or District seats)
- **User Participation**: Anyone can participate, not just registered candidates
- **Target System**: Must specify target candidate for campaign actions

**Special Election Mechanics**

**Signup Phase (24 hours)**
- Use `/special signup candidate_name:"Your Name" party:"Your Party"`
- Multiple users can participate regardless of regular election status
- Get seat information and timeline details

**Campaign Phase (72 hours)**
- All campaign actions have 1-hour cooldowns
- Actions require target candidate specification
- Stamina system: Start with 100, actions cost 15-25 stamina

**Campaign Actions Details**

**1. Special Speech** (`/special speech`)
- Requirements: 700-3000 characters, reply within 5 minutes
- Effect: 2-4 points gained
- Stamina Cost: -20
- Cooldown: 1 hour

**2. Special Poster** (`/special poster`)
- Requirements: Image upload (max 10MB)
- Effect: 1-3 points gained
- Stamina Cost: -15
- Cooldown: 1 hour

- Save high-impact actions for peak activity times

**Resource Allocation**
- Limited stamina requires careful planning
- High-point actions (ads) vs. cost-efficient actions (posters)
- Balance frequency vs. impact

**Competition Dynamics**
- Smaller candidate pools create more focused competition
- Every action directly impacts relative standing
- Late campaign surges can overcome early deficits

**Administrative Guidelines**
- Call special elections only for legitimate vacancies
- Monitor for fair play and rule compliance
- Use polling commands to track race dynamics

**Special Election Polling**
- 7% margin of error (higher than regular elections)
- Smaller sample sizes (300-800 voters)
- More volatile results due to shorter campaign period
- Real-time tracking of candidate momentum"""

                "content": """**Coalition Building Mastery**

**The 3-4-2 Rule**
- 3 Core Demographics: Your absolute base (focus heavily)
- 4 Supporting Demographics: Secondary targets (moderate focus)
- 2 Opportunity Demographics: Stretch goals if resources allow

**Example Progressive Coalition**
- Core: Urban Voters, College-Educated Professionals, Young Voters
- Supporting: Environmental Voters, Tech Workers, LGBTQ+ Voters, Immigrant Communities
- Opportunity: Asian American Voters, Low-Income Voters

**Geographic Optimization Matrix**
Create a matrix showing where your core demographics are strongest:
```
State         | Urban | College | Young | Environmental
California    | 0.25  | 0.25    | 0.25  | 0.25
New York      | 0.25  | 0.25    | 0.25  | 0.10
Colorado      | 0.25  | 0.25    | 0.25  | 0.25
```

**Strategic Targeting Priority**
1. States where all core demographics are strong (0.25 multiplier)
2. States where 2-3 core demographics are strong
3. Swing states where at least 1 core demographic is strong
4. Opponent strongholds only if you have overwhelming advantages

**Advanced Momentum Warfare**

**Momentum Cascade Strategy**
Create chain reactions that build momentum across multiple states:
- **Phase 1:** Build moderate momentum (30-40 points) in 5-6 states
- **Phase 2:** Push one strategic state to vulnerability (50+ momentum)
- **Phase 3:** Spread momentum to other states before collapse occurs

**Counter-Momentum Operations**
Track opponent momentum and plan strategic collapses:
- Week 1-2: Identify opponent momentum patterns
- Week 3-4: Position party members for collapse attempts
- Week 5-6: Execute collapses during crucial campaign moments
- Week 7-8: Follow up with own momentum building

**Resource Optimization Strategies**

**Stamina Management Across Multiple Candidates**
- **Stamina Sharing Protocols:** High-stamina candidates support allies
- **Action Specialization:** Assign specific action types to different candidates
- **Crisis Response Capabilities:** Maintain 20% stamina reserve across party

**Psychological Warfare and Narrative Control**

**Expectation Management**
- **Underdog Positioning:** Set low expectations, exceed them for momentum
- **Frontrunner Discipline:** When ahead, avoid major risks and controversies

**Advanced Geographic Strategies**

**Regional Specialization**
- **Rust Belt Strategy:** Blue-collar voters, economic messaging (MI, OH, PA, WI)
- **Sun Belt Strategy:** Suburban growth, education focus (AZ, GA, NC, TX)
- **Mountain West Strategy:** Environmental issues, individual freedom (CO, NV, UT, MT)

**Micro-Targeting Within States**
- **Urban Cores:** Demographics - Urban voters, minorities, young professionals
- **Suburban Rings:** Demographics - Suburban voters, college-educated, families
- **Rural Areas:** Demographics - Rural voters, gun rights advocates, religious voters

**Opposition Research and Counter-Intelligence**

**Information Gathering**
- Track all opponent campaign actions and effectiveness
- Monitor demographic progress and momentum building
- Analyze resource allocation and strategic priorities

**Strategic Counter-Operations**
- Time major announcements to overshadow opponents
- Use momentum collapses to disrupt opponent campaign rhythm
- Counter-program against opponent's demographic targeting

**Late-Campaign Surge Strategies**

**Resource Conservation vs. All-Out Push**
- **Conservation Strategy** (When Ahead): Maintain minimal presence, focus on preventing opponent momentum
- **Surge Strategy** (When Behind): Spend all remaining resources, take calculated risks

**Closing Argument Development**
- Synthesize campaign themes into final message
- Target undecided voters with moderate positions
- Reinforce base support to ensure turnout

**Special Election Integration**
- Use special elections as testing grounds for new strategies
- Build name recognition for future general elections
- Coordinate with general election campaigns for maximum impact"""

                "content": """**Essential Election Administration**

**Election System Architecture**
Before campaigns begin, configure fundamental election infrastructure:

**Seat Configuration** (`/election admin set_seats`)
Consider these factors:
- **Realistic Representation:** Base seats on actual population/server member counts
- **Election Timing Balance:** Senate (6-year), House (2-year), Governor (4-year), President/VP (4-year)

**Example Seat Configuration:**
```
Large States (CA, TX, NY): 6 Senate seats, 8-12 House districts, 1 Governor
Medium States (PA, OH, MI): 3 Senate seats, 4-6 House districts, 1 Governor  
Small States (WY, VT, DE): 3 Senate seats, 1-2 House districts, 1 Governor
```

**Time Scale Management**
**Realistic Pacing Guidelines:**
- Signup Phase: 3-7 real days
- Primary Campaign: 7-14 real days
- Primary Election: 1-3 real days
- General Campaign: 14-21 real days
- General Election: 1-3 real days

**Time Scale Formulas:**
- Active Server: 30-60 minutes per RP day
- Moderate Server: 60-120 minutes per RP day
- Casual Server: 120-240 minutes per RP day

**Advanced Election Management**

**Multi-Cycle Planning**
- **Presidential Election Years** (Every 4 years): All House, 1/3 Senate, Governors, President/VP
- **Midterm Election Years** (2 years after): All House, 1/3 Senate (different class), some Governors
- **Off-Year Elections**: Special elections only, good for party building

**Voting System Management**
**Hybrid Approach** (Recommended):
- Use automated calculations for most races
- Manual intervention for close races (within 5%)
- Administrative judgment for special circumstances

**Vote Calculation Factors:**
- Campaign points accumulated
- Momentum levels in relevant states
- Demographic coalition strength
- State political leans and multipliers
- Random variance for realism

**Monitoring and Balance**

**Campaign Activity Tracking**
- Track campaign actions per candidate
- Monitor stamina usage patterns
- Identify inactive candidates for intervention

**Fairness and Balance Maintenance**
- **Demographic System Balance:** Monitor coalition effectiveness
- **Momentum System Oversight:** Track accumulation rates and collapse frequency
- **State Balance Verification:** Ensure no states are consistently ignored

**Special Election Administration**
- **Call Special Elections:** `/special admin call_election` for vacant House seats
- **Monitor Special Campaigns:** Track 4-day election cycles
- **Manage Special Results:** Use `/special admin set_winner` if needed

**Advanced Administrative Features**

**Crisis Management Tools**
- Reset campaign cooldowns for technical issues: `/admin system reset_campaign_cooldowns`
- Manually adjust momentum for game balance: `/momentum admin add_momentum`
- Resolve disputes between candidates
- Handle rule violations and enforcement

**Data Management and Analysis**
- Export seat configurations for backup: `/election admin export`
- Analyze historical election data
- Track long-term trends and patterns
- Monitor bot performance and response times

**Common Administrative Challenges**
**Low Engagement Issues:** Reduce time scales, create more competitive races, call special elections
**Over-Engagement Issues:** Increase cooldowns, add more complex strategic elements
**System Balance Problems:** Monitor win rates by party and strategy

**Essential Admin Commands:**
- `/election admin set_seats` - Configure all election seats
- `/time admin set_current_time` - Control election timing and phases
- `/time admin set_time_scale` - Set how many real minutes equal one RP day
- `/momentum admin add_momentum` - Adjust state momentum levels

                "title": "üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting",
                "content": """**Common User Issues and Solutions**

**Command Execution Problems**

**"Command on cooldown" Errors**
- **Cause:** User attempting action before 1-hour cooldown expires
- **Solution:** Wait for cooldown to complete or check remaining time
- **Prevention:** Track cooldowns carefully, all campaign actions now have 1-hour cooldowns
- **Admin Override:** Use `/admin system reset_campaign_cooldowns` if necessary

**Example Resolution Process:**
1. Check remaining cooldown time (usually 1 hour for all actions)
2. Plan next action timing based on cooldown info
3. Use different action types if one is on cooldown
4. Contact admin if cooldown seems incorrect

**"Not in correct phase" Errors**
- **Cause:** Attempting phase-specific actions at wrong time
- **Solution:** Check current phase with `/time current_time`
- **Understanding:** Different actions available in different phases

**Phase-Action Compatibility Guide:**
- **Signup Phase:** `/signup`, `/pres_signup`, `/vp_signup`, `/special signup`
- **Primary Campaign:** All campaign actions, demographic appeals
- **Primary Election:** Voting only, limited campaign actions
- **General Campaign:** Enhanced campaign actions, momentum system
- **General Election:** Voting only, final appeals
- **Governance:** Administrative actions, next cycle preparation
- **Special Elections:** Available anytime for House seats

**Permission and Access Issues**
**"Insufficient permissions" Errors**
- **Cause:** Non-admin attempting admin-only commands
- **Solution:** Contact server administrator for assistance
- **Alternative:** Use equivalent non-admin commands where available

**Registration and Signup Problems**
**"Already signed up" Errors**
- **Solution:** Use `/signup withdraw` first, then re-register
- **Note:** Can run for multiple different offices simultaneously
- **Special Elections:** Separate from regular signups

**"Invalid region/state" Errors**
- **Solution:** Check available regions with `/setup list_regions`
- **Format:** Use exact spelling and capitalization
- **Examples:** "PENNSYLVANIA" not "Pennsylvania"

**Campaign Strategy Troubleshooting**

**Low Campaign Effectiveness Issues**
- **Diagnosis:** Check state demographic multipliers
- **Solution:** Campaign in states where your demographics are strong
- **Tool:** Use `/demographics view_state_demographics` to research
- **Strategy:** Focus on 0.25 multiplier states, avoid 0.05 states

**Example Effectiveness Analysis:**
Target: Rural Voters
- Strong States (0.25): Alabama, Montana, Wyoming
- Moderate States (0.10): Colorado, Pennsylvania
- Weak States (0.05): California, New York
- Action Plan: Campaign for Rural Voters in Alabama/Montana/Wyoming

**Demographic Coalition Problems**
- **Cause:** Targeting conflicting demographic groups
- **Symptoms:** Losing support in demographics you've previously built
- **Prevention:** Plan coalition strategy to avoid major conflicts
- **New System:** No thresholds, focus on building strong coalitions

**Coalition Prevention Strategy:**
1. Map out your core demographic coalition
2. Identify all conflicting demographics for each core group
3. Plan geographic targeting to minimize overlap
4. Focus on states where your demographics have strong multipliers

**Momentum Building Difficulties**
- **Solution:** Increase campaign frequency in target states
- **Strategy:** Build momentum systematically in 2-3 states first
- **Tool:** Use `/momentum status` to track progress

**Momentum Building Best Practices:**
- Week 1-2: Choose 2-3 target states, begin consistent campaigning
- Week 3-4: Build to 30-40 momentum in each target state
- Week 5-6: Expand to 2-3 additional states
- Week 7-8: Maintain momentum, avoid vulnerability thresholds

**Special Election Issues**
- **Short Timeline:** 4-day cycles require aggressive campaigning
- **Stamina Management:** Start with 100, actions cost 15-25
- **Target Requirements:** Must specify target candidate for all actions
- **Solution:** Plan actions around 1-hour cooldowns

**System Performance and Technical Issues**

**Bot Response Problems**
- **Slow Command Response:** Wait for response, avoid spamming commands
- **Failed Command Execution:** Wait and retry command once, screenshot errors
- **Interaction Timeouts:** Re-run commands if interactions expire

**Best Practices for Issue Prevention**

**Strategic Planning**
- Plan campaign strategy before beginning active campaigning
- Research state demographics and momentum systems thoroughly
- Develop contingency plans for various scenarios
- Consider special election opportunities

**Resource Management**
- Track stamina usage and 1-hour cooldown timers carefully
- Maintain reserves for emergency responses
- Plan action timing around server activity patterns
- Coordinate with party members and running mates

**Communication and Coordination**
- Share research and analysis with party members
- Coordinate timing of major campaign actions
- Report issues and problems promptly to admins
- Maintain good sportsmanship and fair play standards

**Updated System Notes**
- All campaign actions now have 1-hour cooldowns
- Demographics have no thresholds - focus on state multipliers
- Special elections available for House seats anytime
- Momentum system more important than ever for effectiveness"""
