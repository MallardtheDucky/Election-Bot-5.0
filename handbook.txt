## 1. Getting Started

### Initial Setup

**Step 1: Basic Configuration**
1. Use `/setup add_region` to add US states to your server
   - Add key battleground states first: Pennsylvania, Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin
   - Include safe red states: Texas, Alabama, Wyoming
   - Include safe blue states: California, New York, Massachusetts
   - Add swing states: Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina

2. Use `/setup set_start` to set your election start date
   - Format: YYYY-MM-DD
   - Example: `/setup set_start 2024-01-01`
   - This determines when your election cycle begins

3. Use `/setup set_announcement_channel` for election updates
   - Choose a channel where all major election events will be announced
   - This includes phase changes, major victories, and results

4. Use `/party admin create` to create custom parties if needed
   - Default parties: Democratic Party (Blue), Republican Party (Red), Independent (Purple)
   - Custom parties allow for roleplay scenarios or alternative political systems
   - Example: `/party admin create name:"Green Party" abbreviation:"G" color:"00FF00"`

5. Use `/election admin set_seats` to configure election seats
   - Sets up all available offices: Senate, House, Governor, President, VP
   - Determines which seats are up for election in each cycle

**Step 2: Understanding Election Phases**

The bot cycles through these phases automatically:

- **Signup Phase** (Duration: Varies)
  - Candidates register for elections using `/signup`
  - Presidential candidates use `/pres_signup`
  - VP candidates use `/vp_signup`
  - This is the planning phase where coalitions form

- **Primary Campaign** (Duration: Usually 2-4 weeks RP time)
  - Candidates campaign within their parties
  - Use demographic appeals and state-specific strategies
  - Build momentum and name recognition
  - Form alliances and endorsements

- **Primary Voting** (Duration: 1-3 days RP time)
  - Automated or admin-controlled voting
  - Winners become party nominees
  - Delegates are allocated in presidential races

- **General Campaign** (Duration: Usually 4-8 weeks RP time)
  - Party nominees face off
  - Momentum system becomes crucial
  - Demographic targeting reaches peak importance
  - Final coalition building

- **General Voting** (Duration: 1-3 days RP time)
  - Final election
  - All previous campaign work pays off
  - Winners determined by accumulated points and momentum

- **Governance** (Duration: Until next election cycle)
  - Winners serve their terms
  - Set up for next election cycle

**Step 3: Time Management**

Understanding the time system is crucial:

- Use `/time current_time` to check the current election phase
- Real time vs RP time: Admins can set how fast time moves
- Example: `/time set_time_scale 60` means 1 real hour = 1 RP day
- Elections automatically progress through phases based on configured timing

**Step 4: Basic Commands Every User Should Know**

Essential commands for all participants:
- `/commands` - View all available commands
- `/time current_time` - Check current phase and date
- `/signup` - Register as a candidate (during signup phase)
- `/speech` - Give a basic campaign speech (1 hour cooldown)
- `/momentum status` - Check state momentum
- `/demographic_status` - View your demographic progress (presidential candidates)

## 2. Basic Election Management

### Setting Up Elections

**Comprehensive Seat Configuration**

The election system supports multiple office types:

1. **Senate Seats** (6-year terms)
   - 3 senators per state in the default configuration
   - Staggered elections (different classes expire different years)
   - High-profile races that affect national politics

2. **House Seats** (2-year terms)
   - Multiple districts per state based on population
   - All seats up for election every cycle
   - More local, district-focused campaigns
   - **Eligible for Special Elections** when vacant

3. **Governor Seats** (4-year terms)
   - One per state
   - Significant state-level executive power
   - Important for party momentum

4. **National Offices** (4-year terms)
   - President and Vice President
   - Highest-profile races
   - Electoral College system simulation

**Election Timing Configuration**

Proper timing is essential for realistic elections:

```
Example Timeline:
- January-March: Signup Phase
- April-June: Primary Campaign
- July: Primary Elections
- August-October: General Campaign
- November: General Election
- December-January: Transition/Governance
```

Use `/time set_time_scale` to control pacing:
- Fast pace: 30 (30 real minutes = 1 RP day)
- Medium pace: 60 (1 real hour = 1 RP day)
- Slow pace: 120 (2 real hours = 1 RP day)

### Candidate Registration Process

**General Election Signup**

During signup phases, candidates use:
- `/signup` for general elections (Senate, House, Governor)
- Must specify: name, party, seat, region/state
- Each user can run for multiple offices if allowed
- Withdrawals possible with `/withdraw_signup`

**Presidential Campaign Registration**

Presidential campaigns are more complex:

1. **Presidential Candidate Registration**
   ```
   /pres_signup name:"John Smith" party:"Democratic Party" 
   ideology:"Liberal" economic:"Progressive" social:"Liberal" 
   government:"Big Government" axis:"Left"
   ```

2. **Vice Presidential Registration**
   ```
   /vp_signup name:"Jane Doe" party:"Democratic Party"
   ideology:"Moderate" economic:"Centrist" social:"Liberal"
   government:"Moderate" axis:"Center-Left"
   presidential_candidate:"John Smith"
   ```

3. **Ticket Formation**
   - Presidential candidate must accept VP with `/accept_vp`
   - Creates official ticket for general election
   - Both candidates share resources and momentum

### Managing the Election Process

**Phase Transitions**

Elections progress automatically, but admins can intervene:

- `/time set_current_time` - Jump to specific date/phase
- Monitor transitions through announcement channel
- Handle disputes or special circumstances
- Adjust timing if needed for server activity

**Vote Management**

Admins have several options for handling votes:

1. **Automated Voting** (Recommended)
   - System calculates results based on campaign activity
   - Points, momentum, and demographics determine outcomes
   - Most realistic and fair approach

2. **Manual Vote Setting**
   ```
   /election vote admin_bulk_set_votes seat_id:"SEN-CA-1" 
   vote_data:"John Smith:25000,Jane Doe:18000,Bob Wilson:12000"
   ```

3. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Let system calculate most results
   - Manually adjust close races for drama
   - Set realistic vote totals for immersion

**Results and Announcements**

The system automatically:
- Announces phase changes
- Declares winners
- Updates seat holders
- Advances term dates for next cycle

Admins can enhance this with:
- Custom victory speeches
- Transition ceremonies
- Next cycle planning announcements

## 3. Campaign Strategies

### Understanding Campaign Actions (Universal 1-Hour Cooldowns)

**MAJOR UPDATE: All campaign actions now have unified 1-hour cooldowns** regardless of action type. This creates more strategic timing decisions and prevents spam while allowing consistent campaign activity.

Each campaign action serves a specific purpose and has different effectiveness:

**1. Speeches** (`/speech`)
- **Purpose**: Build general support and name recognition with ideology bonuses
- **Requirements**: 700-3000 characters, reply within 5 minutes
- **Effectiveness**: 1.5-3.0 points based on length and state ideology match
- **Stamina Cost**: 1.5
- **Cooldown**: 1 hour (unified)
- **Best Used**: Early campaign, building base support, swing states
- **NEW**: Ideology alignment with state provides +0.5% bonus

**2. Canvassing** (`/canvassing`)
- **Purpose**: Target specific regions with ground game
- **Requirements**: 100-300 character message
- **Effectiveness**: High in targeted regions, momentum multipliers apply
- **Stamina Cost**: 1
- **Cooldown**: 1 hour (unified)
- **Best Used**: Swing states, competitive districts
- **Tips**: Focus on states where you're competitive

**3. Advertisements** (`/ad`)
- **Purpose**: Wide reach across multiple regions
- **Requirements**: Video file upload (25MB max), reply within 5 minutes
- **Effectiveness**: 0.5-1% polling boost, high impact
- **Stamina Cost**: 1.5
- **Cooldown**: 1 hour (unified)
- **Best Used**: Late campaign, major media markets
- **Tips**: Save for crucial moments, requires video upload

**4. Posters** (`/poster`)
- **Purpose**: Cost-efficient way to build name recognition
- **Requirements**: Image upload (10MB max)
- **Effectiveness**: 0.25-0.5% polling boost, consistent presence
- **Stamina Cost**: 1
- **Cooldown**: 1 hour (unified)
- **Best Used**: Continuous presence, early campaign
- **Tips**: Maintain steady presence, cost-effective option

**5. Donor Appeals** (`/donor`)
- **Purpose**: High-risk, high-reward fundraising
- **Requirements**: 400-3000 characters, reply within 5 minutes
- **Effectiveness**: Up to 3% boost based on length
- **Stamina Cost**: 1.5
- **Cooldown**: 1 hour (unified)
- **Side Effect**: +5 corruption (scandal risk)
- **Best Used**: Crisis response, building war chest
- **Warning**: High corruption leads to scandals

### Advanced Action Strategies

**Timing Your Actions (New Unified System)**

With 1-hour universal cooldowns, timing becomes critical:

1. **Peak Activity Windows**
   - Schedule actions during server's peak hours
   - Coordinate with allies to avoid overlap
   - Plan around opponent's likely action times

2. **Action Cycling Strategy**
   - Use different action types in rotation
   - Example: Speech → Poster → Canvassing → Ad → repeat
   - Maintains constant presence without waste

3. **Crisis Response Planning**
   - Always keep one action "in reserve" for emergencies
   - Quick response to opponent attacks or scandals
   - Coordinate rapid response with campaign team

**Regional Targeting Strategy**

**Tier 1: Must-Win States**
- Your party's traditional strongholds
- States where you lead in early polling
- Focus 40% of your campaign resources here
- Never neglect these states

**Tier 2: Competitive States**
- True swing states
- States where you trail by <10 points
- Focus 50% of your campaign resources here
- Where elections are won and lost

**Tier 3: Stretch Goals**
- States where you trail by 10-20 points
- Opposition strongholds with potential
- Focus 10% of your campaign resources here
- Only target if you're ahead elsewhere

**Action Effectiveness by Region Type**

Different actions work better in different types of areas:

- **Urban Areas**: Ads and demographic appeals work best
- **Suburban Areas**: Canvassing and speeches effective
- **Rural Areas**: Speeches and poster campaigns resonate
- **Swing Areas**: All actions effective, focus on momentum

### Resource Management

**Stamina System**

Every action costs stamina, which regenerates over time:

- **Total Stamina**: 100 for general candidates, 200 for presidential
- **Regeneration**: 50 per day (general), 100 per day (presidential)
- **Critical Threshold**: Below 20 stamina = reduced effectiveness
- **Emergency Reserve**: Always keep 10-15 stamina for responses

**Stamina Optimization Strategies**

1. **Steady Pace Strategy** (Recommended)
   - Use 1-2 actions per day consistently
   - Allows for emergency responses
   - Sustainable throughout campaign
   - Best for: Most campaigns

2. **Front-Loading Strategy**
   - Spend heavily early to build momentum
   - Risk: May run out of stamina for final push
   - Best for: Underdogs who need early attention

3. **Back-Loading Strategy**
   - Conserve stamina for final weeks
   - Risk: May fall too far behind early
   - Best for: Frontrunners with name recognition

**Cooldown Management (Critical)**

With unified 1-hour cooldowns, planning is essential:

- **Track Your Timing**: Note exactly when each action was used
- **Plan Ahead**: Schedule actions during peak server activity
- **Coordinate**: If running with allies, stagger your actions
- **Emergency Actions**: Always have an action available for crisis response

### Coalition Building and Alliances

**Formal Alliances**

- **Running Mates**: Presidential tickets share resources and momentum
- **Party Unity**: Support other candidates from your party
- **Cross-Party Deals**: Sometimes useful in complex multi-party scenarios

**Informal Coordination**

- **Resource Sharing**: Help allies when you're not campaigning
- **Strategic Timing**: Coordinate major announcements
- **Opposition Research**: Share intelligence about opponents
- **Crisis Management**: Support allies during scandals or attacks

## 4. Demographics & Targeting (Updated No-Threshold System)

### **MAJOR SYSTEM UPDATE: No More Thresholds**

The demographic system has been completely overhauled. **Demographic groups no longer have point thresholds to reach**. Instead, the system focuses on:

- **State Multiplier Effects**: Small (0.05x), Moderate (0.10x), Strong (0.25x)
- **Continuous Scaling**: Every point counts, no arbitrary thresholds
- **Conflict System**: Targeting opposing demographics creates backlash
- **Strategic Depth**: More nuanced coalition building

### Understanding the New Demographic System

**Complete Demographic List (No Thresholds)**

1. **Geographic Demographics**
   - Urban Voters
   - Suburban Voters
   - Rural Voters

2. **Religious Demographics**
   - Evangelical Christians

3. **Racial/Ethnic Demographics**
   - African American Voters
   - Latino/Hispanic Voters
   - Asian American Voters
   - Native American Voters

4. **Economic Demographics**
   - Blue-Collar / Working-Class Voters
   - College-Educated Professionals
   - Wealthy / High-Income Voters
   - Low-Income Voters
   - Tech & Innovation Workers

5. **Age Demographics**
   - Young Voters (18–29)
   - Senior Citizens (65+)

6. **Special Interest Demographics**
   - Military & Veteran Voters
   - LGBTQ+ Voters
   - Immigrant Communities
   - Environmental & Green Voters
   - Gun Rights Advocates

### State Demographic Multipliers

Every state has different demographic compositions that multiply your effectiveness:

**Multiplier System**
- **Strong (0.25x)**: Demographics very influential in that state
- **Moderate (0.10x)**: Average influence
- **Small (0.05x)**: Limited influence

**Example: Campaigning for Rural Voters**
- **Strong States**: Alabama, Montana, Wyoming (0.25x multiplier)
- **Moderate States**: Colorado, Pennsylvania (0.10x multiplier)
- **Small States**: California, New York (0.05x multiplier)

**Strategic Implications**
A 1.0 point demographic appeal becomes:
- Alabama: 0.25 points (very effective)
- Colorado: 0.10 points (moderately effective)
- California: 0.05 points (barely effective)

### Enhanced Conflict System

**Understanding Backlash**

The system includes a sophisticated backlash mechanism based on **continuous scaling** rather than thresholds:

**Backlash Triggers**
- **High Investment**: Spending significant points in one demographic
- **Opposing Groups**: Targeting demographics that conflict with each other
- **Geographic Mismatches**: Campaigning for demographics in hostile states

**Major Conflict Pairs**
- Urban Voters ↔ Rural Voters
- Young Voters ↔ Senior Citizens
- Gun Rights Advocates ↔ Environmental Voters
- Evangelical Christians ↔ LGBTQ+ Voters
- Blue-Collar Workers ↔ College-Educated Professionals
- Wealthy Voters ↔ Low-Income Voters

**Complex Conflict Networks**

Some demographics have multiple conflicts:
- Gun Rights Advocates oppose: Environmental Voters, Urban Voters, College-Educated Professionals, most minority groups
- Tech Workers oppose: Blue-Collar Workers, Senior Citizens, Gun Rights Advocates

### Demographic Campaign Strategies (Updated)

**1. Focused Excellence Strategy**

Pick 2-3 compatible demographics and maximize effectiveness:

**Example Progressive Coalition**
- Urban Voters (target high-urban states like CA, NY, IL)
- College-Educated Professionals (target educated suburbs)
- Environmental Voters (target green-conscious states like WA, OR)

**Execution**
- Campaign ONLY in states where these demographics are strong
- Ignore states where your demographics are weak
- Accept that you'll lose rural/conservative areas
- Build overwhelming strength in favorable areas

**2. Broad Appeal Strategy**

Try to appeal to many demographics without triggering major backlash:

**Example Centrist Approach**
- Target demographics with fewer conflicts
- Avoid the most polarizing groups
- Example: Suburban Voters + Military Veterans + Senior Citizens
- Campaign in diverse states to minimize conflict exposure

**3. Counter-Programming Strategy**

Deliberately target your opponent's coalition:

**Disruption Tactics**
- If opponent is strong with Young Voters, target Senior Citizens in same states
- Use backlash system to weaken opponent's base
- Force opponent to defend their coalition
- Particularly effective in primaries

**4. Geographic Specialization Strategy**

Completely dominate specific types of states:

**Example Rural Dominance**
- Focus only on Rural Voters + Gun Rights Advocates + Evangelical Christians
- Campaign exclusively in rural-strong states
- Accept complete loss in urban areas
- Build unstoppable coalition in your geographic base

### Demographic Action Types (Updated)

**1. Demographic Speeches** (`/demographic_speech`)
- **Points Gained**: 0.5-1.5 based on speech length and quality
- **Stamina Cost**: 2.0
- **Cooldown**: 8 hours (separate from general actions)
- **Requirements**: 400-2000 character speech text
- **Best For**: Major policy announcements, rallies

**2. Demographic Posters** (`/demographic_poster`)
- **Points Gained**: 0.3-0.8 (random)
- **Stamina Cost**: 1.5
- **Cooldown**: 6 hours (separate from general actions)
- **Requirements**: Image upload
- **Best For**: Consistent presence, visual messaging

**3. Demographic Ads** (`/demographic_ad`)
- **Points Gained**: 0.8-1.5 (random)
- **Stamina Cost**: 2.5
- **Cooldown**: 10 hours (separate from general actions)
- **Requirements**: Video upload (25MB max)
- **Best For**: High-impact moments, major media markets

### Advanced Demographic Tactics (Updated)

**Geographic Optimization**

Use state multipliers to maximize efficiency:

**Research Phase**
1. Use `/view_state_demographics` to see all state multipliers
2. Identify states where your target demographics are strong
3. Plan campaign routes focusing on favorable states
4. Ignore states where your demographics are weak

**Execution Phase**
1. Campaign for Rural Voters ONLY in Montana, Wyoming, Alabama
2. Campaign for Urban Voters ONLY in California, New York, Illinois
3. Use Suburban Voters in purple states like Pennsylvania, Michigan

**No-Threshold Optimization**

Without thresholds, every point matters:

**Continuous Investment**
- No "reaching threshold and stopping"
- Every additional point provides value
- Focus on multiplier efficiency over raw points
- 100 points in a 0.25x state = 25 effective points
- 400 points in a 0.05x state = 20 effective points

**Conflict Avoidance**

Since there are no thresholds to "safely reach":

**Smart Coalition Building**
- Monitor backlash carefully as you build
- Consider geographic separation of conflicting demographics
- Use different states for different parts of your coalition
- Example: Rural campaign in Montana, Urban campaign in California

## 5. Momentum System

### Understanding Political Momentum

The momentum system simulates how political parties gain and lose influence in states based on campaign activity, scandals, and voter sentiment. It's a dynamic system that can dramatically alter election outcomes.

**Core Momentum Mechanics**

**Momentum Accumulation**
- Successful campaign actions build momentum
- Momentum multiplies the effectiveness of future actions
- High momentum makes everything easier
- Momentum decays over time without activity

**Momentum Vulnerability**
- Parties with high momentum (50+ points) become vulnerable
- Opponents can trigger "momentum collapse"
- Collapses cause massive momentum loss (30-70%)
- Vulnerable parties have warning indicators (⚠️)

**State-Specific System**
- Each state tracks momentum separately for each party
- State political lean affects momentum gain rates
- Different states have different volatility levels
- Momentum affects polling and final vote calculations

### State Political Leans

Every state has a baseline political lean that affects momentum:

**Lean Intensities and Effects**
- **Strong Lean** (1.5x momentum gain): Deep red/blue states
- **Moderate Lean** (1.2x momentum gain): Typical partisan states  
- **Weak Lean** (1.0x momentum gain): Light red/blue states
- **Swing State** (0.8x momentum gain): True purple states

**Examples by Category**
- **Strong Republican**: Alabama, Wyoming, Idaho
- **Moderate Republican**: Texas, Georgia, Ohio
- **Weak Republican**: Florida, North Carolina
- **Swing States**: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin
- **Weak Democratic**: Virginia, Colorado, Nevada
- **Moderate Democratic**: Illinois, Oregon, Connecticut
- **Strong Democratic**: California, Massachusetts, Hawaii

### Building Momentum

**Primary Momentum Sources**

1. **Successful Campaign Actions**
   - Speeches, ads, canvassing all build momentum
   - More effective actions = more momentum gained
   - Consistent activity in a state compounds momentum

2. **Demographic Targeting Success**
   - Effective demographic campaigns create lasting momentum
   - Geographic targeting multiplies momentum gains
   - No longer tied to threshold achievement

3. **Coalition Building**
   - Endorsements from local figures
   - Cross-party cooperation in some scenarios
   - Grassroots organization building

**Momentum Building Strategies**

**1. Fortress Strategy**
- Pick 2-3 states to completely dominate
- Campaign relentlessly in these states
- Build massive momentum reserves
- Use as launching pad for expansion

**2. Expansion Strategy**
- Start with natural strongholds
- Gradually expand to competitive states
- Maintain presence everywhere
- More risky but higher potential reward

**3. Surgical Strategy**
- Focus on specific types of states
- Example: Target only suburban swing states
- Deep expertise in chosen battlegrounds
- Efficient resource allocation

### Momentum Collapse System

**Vulnerability Triggers**
- Momentum above 50.0 points creates vulnerability
- Vulnerability marked with ⚠️ in status displays
- Multiple party members can trigger collapses
- 6-hour cooldown between collapse attempts

**Collapse Mechanics**
- Reduces momentum by 30-70% of current total
- Affected party loses momentum immediately
- May trigger state lean shifts in extreme cases
- Creates opportunities for opponents

**Defensive Strategies**

**Momentum Management**
- Monitor momentum levels carefully
- Consider deliberately reducing momentum before vulnerability
- Build momentum in multiple states to spread risk
- Coordinate with party members for defense

**Counter-Collapse Tactics**
- Keep some party members ready to trigger collapses
- Monitor opponent momentum for opportunities
- Time collapse attempts for maximum impact
- Coordinate multiple collapse attempts if possible

**Recovery Strategies**
- Diversify momentum across multiple states
- Have backup campaign plans ready
- Use collapses as opportunity to pivot strategy
- Rally party supporters after opponent attacks

### Advanced Momentum Tactics

**Momentum Warfare**

**Offensive Operations**
1. **Vulnerability Creation**
   - Force opponents to build high momentum
   - Create single-state dependencies
   - Time attacks for maximum disruption

2. **Collapse Timing**
   - Strike during crucial campaign phases
   - Coordinate with major news cycles
   - Target states where opponent needs momentum most

3. **Chain Reactions**
   - One collapse can create vulnerability elsewhere
   - Target interconnected state strategies
   - Force opponent into defensive positions

**Defensive Operations**

1. **Redundancy Building**
   - Never depend on single state for momentum
   - Build overlapping momentum networks
   - Create multiple paths to victory

2. **Early Warning Systems**
   - Monitor opponent party member activity
   - Track momentum levels across all states
   - Prepare rapid response capabilities

3. **Damage Control**
   - Have crisis communication plans ready
   - Practice rapid momentum rebuilding
   - Maintain reserve campaign resources

## 9. Advanced Strategies

### Coalition Building Mastery (Updated for No-Threshold System)

**Multi-Demographic Coalition Architecture**

With the removal of thresholds, coalition building becomes more fluid and strategic:

**The Continuous Investment Rule**
- Every point matters, no arbitrary stopping points
- Focus on multiplier efficiency over raw point accumulation
- 100 points in a 0.25x state = 25 effective points
- 500 points in a 0.05x state = 25 effective points

**Geographic Specialization Strategy**

Build overwhelming strength in favorable areas:

**Example Progressive Coalition**
- **Core States**: California, New York, Massachusetts (Urban + College-Educated strong)
- **Secondary States**: Colorado, Washington, Oregon (Environmental + Tech strong)
- **Avoid**: Alabama, Wyoming, Mississippi (all demographics weak)

**Resource Allocation**: 80% in strong states, 20% in secondary states

**Conflict Avoidance Matrix**

Create a matrix showing safe demographic combinations:

```
Safe Combinations:
Urban + College-Educated + Environmental = Low conflict
Rural + Gun Rights + Evangelical = Low conflict
Blue-Collar + Low-Income + Union = Low conflict

High Conflict Combinations:
Urban + Rural = High backlash
Young + Senior = High backlash
Environmental + Gun Rights = Extreme backlash
```

### Advanced Campaign Timing (1-Hour Cooldown Optimization)

**Peak Efficiency Scheduling**

With universal 1-hour cooldowns, timing becomes critical:

**Server Activity Patterns**
- **Peak Hours**: 6-10 PM local time

**Action Scheduling Strategy**
1. **Prime Time Actions**: Speeches and Ads during peak hours
2. **Maintenance Actions**: Posters during low activity
3. **Response Actions**: Keep one slot available for crisis response

**Multi-Candidate Coordination**

For party members or allied candidates:

**Staggered Action Plan**
- Candidate A: Actions at :00 minutes

Before campaigns begin, configure fundamental election infrastructure:

**Seat Configuration** (`/election admin set_seats`)

Consider these factors:
- **Realistic Representation**: Base seats on actual population/server member counts
- **Election Timing Balance**: Senate (6-year), House (2-year), Governor (4-year), President/VP (4-year)
- **Special Election Readiness**: Ensure House seats are properly configured for special elections

**Example Seat Configuration:**
```
Large States (CA, TX, NY): 6 Senate seats, 8-12 House districts, 1 Governor
Medium States (PA, OH, MI): 3 Senate seats, 4-6 House districts, 1 Governor  
Small States (WY, VT, DE): 3 Senate seats, 1-2 House districts, 1 Governor
```

**Time Scale Management**

**Realistic Pacing Guidelines:**

## 11. Troubleshooting

### Common User Issues

**Action Cooldown Problems**

**"Command not available" errors**
- Check exact cooldown remaining with status commands
- Universal 1-hour cooldowns apply to all campaign actions
- Special election actions have separate cooldown timers
- Presidential actions may have different cooldown periods

**Solution Steps:**
1. Use `/time current_time` to check current phase
2. Verify you're in correct election phase for the action
3. Check your candidate registration status
4. Wait for full cooldown period before retrying

**Stamina Depletion Issues**

**"Not enough stamina" errors**
- Stamina regenerates daily (50 for general, 100 for presidential)
- Actions cost different amounts of stamina
- Special elections start with 100 stamina, no regeneration

**Management Tips:**
- Plan stamina usage across multiple days
- Save emergency stamina for crisis response
- Use lower-cost actions (posters) for maintenance campaigning
- Coordinate with allies to share stamina burden

**Target System Confusion**

**"Target candidate not found" errors**
- All actions now require specifying target candidate
- Target must be registered candidate in current election
- Use autocomplete to see available candidates
- Special elections have separate candidate pools

**Best Practices:**
- Use `/view_signups` to see available candidates
- Use autocomplete features for target selection
- Verify candidate names match exactly
- Check if targeting yourself vs. other candidates

### Demographic System Issues

**No-Threshold System Confusion**

**"How do I know if I'm winning?" questions**
- No more thresholds means every point counts
- Focus on efficiency through state multipliers
- Monitor relative progress against opponents
- Use `/demographic_status` for progress tracking

**Strategic Guidance:**
- 100 points in 0.25x state = 25 effective points
- 400 points in 0.05x state = 20 effective points
- Choose states where your demographics are strongest
- Avoid states where you have weak multipliers

**Conflict System Problems**

**Unexpected backlash effects**
- Targeting opposing demographics creates backlash
- Geographic separation can reduce conflicts
- Some demographics have multiple conflict relationships
- Backlash scales with investment level

**Conflict Avoidance:**
- Study demographic conflict chart carefully
- Use different states for conflicting demographics
- Monitor backlash indicators during campaigns
- Plan coalition strategies to minimize conflicts

### Special Election Troubleshooting

**Signup Phase Issues**

**"No active special elections" errors**
- Special elections must be called by admins
- Only House seats are eligible for special elections
- Signup phase lasts only 24 hours
- Check `/special calendar` for current status

**Campaign Phase Problems**

**Shorter timeline confusion**
- Special elections last only 4 days total
- All cooldowns are 1 hour in special elections
- No stamina regeneration during campaign
- Actions cost more stamina than regular elections

**Results and Winner Issues**

**"Results not showing" problems**
- Results calculated based on points accumulated
- Admin may need to manually declare winner
- Points visible through polling commands during campaign
- Final results announced automatically at campaign end

### Momentum System Troubleshooting

**Momentum Vulnerability Confusion**

**"Why am I vulnerable?" questions**
- Vulnerability occurs at 50+ momentum points
- Vulnerable parties show ⚠️ warning indicator
- Opponents can trigger momentum collapse
- 6-hour cooldown between collapse attempts

**Defensive Strategies:**
- Monitor momentum levels in all states
- Diversify momentum across multiple states
- Keep party members ready for defense
- Plan backup strategies for post-collapse recovery

**Collapse Recovery Issues**

**"How to recover from collapse?" questions**
- Collapses reduce momentum by 30-70%
- Focus rebuilding in your strongest states
- Use crisis as opportunity to pivot strategy
- Coordinate party-wide recovery efforts

### Presidential Campaign Troubleshooting

**VP Selection Problems**

**"Can't find VP candidates" issues**
- VP candidates must register separately
- Presidential candidate must accept VP choice
- Both must be from same party typically
- Check `/view_pres_signups` for available VPs

**Enhanced Action Confusion**

**Presidential action cost concerns**
- Presidential actions cost more stamina
- Effects are enhanced compared to regular actions
- 200 stamina pool vs. 100 for regular candidates
- Daily regeneration is 100 vs. 50 for regular

### Admin Troubleshooting

**Election Setup Issues**

**Seat configuration problems**
- Use `/election admin set_seats` for initial setup
- Ensure House seats are marked correctly for special elections
- Verify state names match demographic system
- Test configuration before major elections

**Time Scale Problems**

**"Time moving too fast/slow" issues**
- Use `/time set_time_scale` to adjust pacing
- Consider server activity levels when setting scale
- Monitor user feedback on campaign length
- Adjust based on participation patterns

**Special Election Management**

**Calling special elections incorrectly**
- Only House seats eligible for special elections
- Use proper seat ID format
- Provide clear reason for calling election
- Ensure adequate admin coverage for 4-day period

### System Performance Issues

**Database Performance**

**Slow command responses**
- Monitor database query performance
- Optimize frequently used commands
- Consider database maintenance during low activity
- Plan for scaling as server grows

**Discord API Limits**

**Rate limiting errors**
- Bot may hit Discord API rate limits during peak usage
- Implement queuing for non-critical operations
- Prioritize user-facing commands over background tasks
- Monitor API usage patterns

### Emergency Procedures

**System Failure Recovery**

**Database corruption or loss**
- Maintain regular database backups
- Document recovery procedures
- Test backup restoration process
- Communicate with users during outages

**Critical Bug Discovery**

**Game-breaking bugs during active campaigns**
- Document bug behavior immediately
- Implement temporary workarounds if possible
- Communicate transparently with affected users
- Plan compensation for significantly affected campaigns

**User Disputes**

**Escalation procedures**
- Gather all relevant logs and evidence
- Provide fair hearing for all parties
- Make decisions based on documented evidence
- Maintain consistency with previous rulings

### Prevention and Best Practices

**Regular Maintenance**

**Weekly Tasks**
- Review system logs for errors
- Monitor campaign balance and participation
- Check database performance metrics
- Update documentation as needed

**Monthly Tasks**
- Analyze user engagement patterns
- Review and update system balance
- Plan upcoming special elections
- Conduct system performance review

**Quarterly Tasks**
- Comprehensive system review
- User feedback collection and analysis
- Major feature planning and development
- Documentation updates and improvements

This comprehensive handbook should now cover all the major updates and changes to the election bot system, including special elections, the new no-threshold demographic system, universal 1-hour cooldowns, and updated strategies that reflect these changes.
